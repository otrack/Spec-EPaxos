# Spec-EPaxos

There are three existing modules for the execution, the commit, and the recovery protocols of EPaxos, The recovery protocol folder contains the full Commit + Recovery spec. There is also a SMRspec model in the SMRSpec folder (first step I did, mostly for training).
The OneSystemSpec folder is an unsuccessful attempt to use modules properly in building my spec.

To run the model, use the following command as a template (you will need the tla2tools jar downloaded on your system) :
java -cp $PATH_TO_tla2tools.jar$/tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC $SPEC_FILE_NAME$.tla
the .cfg file can be modified to change the parameters with which the model is ran.

## Interactive Animation

The `animation/` directory contains an interactive JavaScript visualization of the EPaxos protocol based on the `EPaxosRecovery/EPaxosCommitWithRecovery.tla` specification. Open `animation/index.html` in a web browser to explore the protocol with 5 replicas, dependency graphs, and step-by-step execution. See [animation/README.md](animation/README.md) for details.
